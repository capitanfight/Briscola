        <h1>Rules of Briscola</h1>

        <ul id="main-list">
            <li>
                <h2 class="sub-title">Number of Players</h2>
                <p class="content">Briscola is played with 2 or 4 players.
                    In the case of 4 players, the game is played in teams, with teammates sitting opposite each other.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2 class="sub-title">Deck of Cards</h2>
                <p class="content">A traditional Italian deck of <b>40 cards</b> is used, divided into four suits: <b>Cups, Coins, Swords, Clubs</b>.
                    Each suit has 10 cards, numbered from 1 (Ace) to 7, and three face cards: Jack (8), Knight (9), and King (10).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2 class="sub-title">Dealing Cards</h2>
                <p class="content">Each player receives 3 cards.
                    After dealing, one card is placed face-up — its suit becomes the Briscola (trump suit), which outranks the others during play.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2 class="sub-title">Objective of the Game</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>The goal is to accumulate the highest possible score by winning cards from your opponents.
                        Each card has a specific point value:</p>
                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li><b>Ace (1)</b>: 11 points</li>
                        <li><b>3</b>: 10 points</li>
                        <li><b>King (10)</b>: 4 points</li>
                        <li><b>Knight (9)</b>: 3 points</li>
                        <li><b>Jack (8)</b>: 2 points</li>
                        <li>Cards 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are worth 0 points</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2 class="sub-title">How the Game is Played</h2>
                <p class="content">Starting with the player to the dealer’s right and continuing counterclockwise, each player plays a card of their choice — there is no obligation to follow suit.
                    The trick is won by the highest Briscola card played. If no Briscola is played, the highest card of the suit that led the trick wins.
                    A trump (Briscola) card beats all other suits unless a higher Briscola is played.
                    The winner of the trick collects the cards and starts the next round by drawing a new card from the deck, followed by the others.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2 class="sub-title">The Briscola</h2>
                <p class="content">The trump suit (Briscola) is determined by the face-up card revealed at the start of the game.
                    Briscola cards beat all cards from other suits.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2 class="sub-title">Final Scoring</h2>
                <p class="content">The game ends when all cards have been played.
                    Players (or teams) sum the point values of the cards they have won.
                    The total points in the deck always add up to <b>120 points</b>.
                    The player or team with the highest total wins the game.</p>
            </li>
